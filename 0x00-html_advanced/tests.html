    <p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low
    throughput, and low altitude service. The
    connection topology is limited to a single
    point-to-point path for each carrier, used with
    standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
    without significant interference with each other,
    outside of early spring. This is because of the 3D
    ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
    to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers
    have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which
    increases availability.</p>
